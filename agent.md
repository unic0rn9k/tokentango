# General instructions
- Git commit and push after every successful task completion
- Don't use `git add .`, instead add all the files you have edited individually
- CRITICAL: Do NOT push changes until you have properly verified your work works correctly

- Code execution duration: The data loading in `fake_news_bert.py` can take significant time because it loads from `995,000_rows.csv`
- To reduce data loading time, modify the `frac` parameter in `load_data(frac)` call in `fake_news_bert.py`, where frac can be 0.8 for a full test (almost. don't use 1 tho), and 0.01 for something that should just test code logic, and not model performance
- Set shell command execution timeout appropriatly depending on usecase:
    - retraining a model can take multiple hours, depending on epochs etc,
    - validating a model can take 15-30 min,
    - and testing code logic with small fraction of training data should only take 5 min at most.


# TODO
- [x] add logic to `fake_news_bert.py` to make it load `checkpoint.pth`
    - if the checkpoint exists, then skip the training and go straight to model validation.

- [x] test and debug `fake_news_bert.py`
    - first, since the file is a marimo notebook, that has been directly converted from ipynb format, add some print statements, so you can tell whats going on.
    - use `uv run fake_news_bert.py` to run the notebook in console only mode. You should now see the output from your print statements.

- [x] clean project root, there is a lot of unorganized files, find a better project structure
    - use `find` to list current directory structure and consider how new structure should look
    - create folders and move files
    - update paths in any python files or other scripts (refrain from editing ipynb files)
    - specifically verify that `fake_news_bert.py` still works

- [x] better accuracy scoring
    - rewrite the `tokentango.train.test_accuracy` method to take the fraction of validation data to testa against as an argument
    - replace other instances of code that computes validation accuracy with a call to this method

- [ ] Use batching in accuracy score
    - test execution time of current implementation, and save it to a file
    - implement batching in the method for potential performance speed-up
    - test execution time again, and append to file
    - if it is slower, revert your changes and mark todo item as done
    - if it is faster, keep your changes and mark todo item as done
